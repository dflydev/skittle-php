Skittle
http://github.com/dflydev/skittle-php

Skittle is a lightweight pure PHP template inclusion library. Its primary goal
is to allow for the easy inclusion of template fragments into other templates.
Originally designed to be used with Halo, Skittle has been extracted so that
it can be used on its own.
